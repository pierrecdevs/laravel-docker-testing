# Laravel Docker Testing

This repo houses docker and laravel.

Some scripts have been made to make things easier for you.

This is just for personal building though, although PRs are welcomed... I don't think it'll be actively mainatined.

## GitHub Actions

Due to GH actions failing I'll be removing any unit tests that require caching until I can figure it out.
Running the tests locally works though!
